#Kaggle Projects

This folder contains a tutorial that I wrote for an data-science focused educational website and service.
Will be published soon in May. 

The tutorial teaches you how to get started with Kaggle competitions by workinf through the newer Ames, Iowa ["House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition. 
I demonstrating a typical workflow, from acquiring the data to engineering features and making a first submission. 

Hope you enjoy!
